# IOT
IOT application built with the goal of detecting obstacles in the  			path of  the vehicle and direct the alternative path on its own. This application uses Ultrasonic sensors(SR04) which can calculate the distance from vehicle to obstacle and tries to take another path. (Bagged 1st place for this project)   
Language         : Embedded C.
Working Platform : Arduino IDE.
Tool             : ArdinoUNO, Ultrasonic sensors, DC motor,5V Battery.
